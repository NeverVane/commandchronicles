*Transform your command line experience: From basic history to intelligent, searchable command management*

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# One line install
curl -sSL https://get.commandchronicles.dev | bash
```

#or

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NeverVane/commandchronicles.git
cd commandchronicles

# Build the binary
go build -o ccr

# Move to your PATH
sudo mv ccr /usr/local/bin/
```

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Initialize CommandChronicles
ccr init

# Automatically install shell hooks (recommended)
ccr install-hooks --auto

# Or manually install for specific shell
ccr install-hooks zsh
ccr install-hooks bash

# Enable auto-sync daemon (recommended)
ccr daemon-control install-service
ccr daemon-control start
```

After installation, restart your shell or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # for zsh
source ~/.bashrc # for bash
```

## üìñ Usage

### Interactive Search (TUI)

Press `Ctrl+R` in your shell to launch the interactive TUI search interface.

**TUI Key Bindings:**
- `‚Üë/‚Üì` - Navigate through commands
- `Enter` - Copy command to shell prompt
- `Ctrl+J` - Execute command immediately
- `Tab` - View detailed command information
- `Ctrl+F` - Toggle fuzzy search
- `Ctrl+F+N` - Toggle combined notes+commands search
- `Ctrl+N` - Edit note for selected command
- `Ctrl+S` - Show only successful commands
- `Ctrl+X` - Show only failed commands
- `Ctrl+T` - View statistics
- `Ctrl+K` - Clear search
- `?` - Show help
- `Esc/Ctrl+C` - Exit

**Important TUI Behavior:**
- **Shell Integration Required**: Command injection (Enter/Ctrl+J) only works when TUI is launched via `Ctrl+R` after installing shell hooks
- **Direct TUI Calls**: Running `ccr tui` directly will show the interface but cannot inject commands into your shell
- **Recommended Usage**: Always use `Ctrl+R` for interactive command search and selection
- **Installation**: Run `ccr install-hooks` to enable full TUI functionality
- **Note Editing**: Use `Ctrl+N` to edit notes directly in the TUI interface
- **Combined Search**: Use `Ctrl+F+N` to search both commands and notes simultaneously

### Command Line Search

```bash
# Search for commands containing "git"
ccr search git

# Search with fuzzy matching
ccr search --fuzzy "gt sttus"

# Filter by exit code
ccr search --exit-code 0 "docker"

# Filter by directory
ccr search --directory /project "npm"

# Filter by time
ccr search --since 1h "build"
ccr search --since 2d --until 1d "test"
```

### Note System

CommandChronicles includes a comprehensive note system for annotating your commands with context, explanations, and reminders.

![Note System](docs/images/features/noteSystem.png)

*Add rich, multi-line notes to your commands with the integrated note editor*

```bash
# Add a note to a command (use command ID from search results)
ccr note add 123 "This command deploys to production"

# Edit an existing note
ccr note edit 123 "Updated: This command deploys to staging environment"

# View a note
ccr note show 123

# List all commands with notes
ccr note list

# Search within notes
ccr note search "deployment"

# Delete a note
ccr note delete 123
```

**Note Features:**
- **Multi-line support**: Notes can span multiple lines with proper formatting
- **Character limit**: 1000 characters maximum per note
- **Encrypted storage**: Notes are encrypted alongside command data
- **Visual indicators**: Commands with notes show a colored dot (‚óè) in the TUI
- **Integrated search**: Use `Ctrl+F+N` in TUI for combined command+note searching
- **Rich editing**: Full-featured note editor with word wrapping in TUI

**TUI Note Editing:**
- Press `Ctrl+N` on any command to open the note editor
- **Multi-line editing**: Press `Enter` for new lines, `Ctrl+S` to save, `Esc` to cancel
- **Real-time validation**: Character count display with 1000 character limit
- **Word wrapping**: Automatic text wrapping for long content
- **Visual feedback**: Commands with notes show a colored indicator (‚óè) in the list
- **Responsive design**: Editor adapts to terminal size automatically

### Tag System

CommandChronicles includes a comprehensive tag system for categorizing and organizing your commands with visual indicators and powerful search capabilities.

![Tag System](docs/images/features/tagSystem.png)

*Organize and categorize your commands with color-coded tags for better workflow management*

```bash
# Add a tag to a command (use command ID from search results)
ccr tag add 123 "docker"

# Remove a tag from a command
ccr tag remove 123 "docker"

# List all tags for a command
ccr tag list 123

# Show all commands with tags
ccr tag show

# Search commands by tag
ccr tag search "docker"
```

**Tag Features:**
- **Tag limits**: Up to 5 tags per command, 50 characters maximum per tag
- **Color customization**: Per-tag color configuration for better visual organization
- **Auto-tagging engine**: Intelligent automatic tagging based on command patterns
- **Default tag rules**: Pre-configured tags for common categories (docker, git, file-ops, network, system, etc.)
- **Encrypted storage**: Tags are encrypted alongside command data
- **Visual indicators**: Tagged commands display colored tag badges in the TUI
- **Integrated search**: Tag-based filtering and search capabilities

**TUI Tag Integration:**
- Tags appear as colored badges in the command list
- View tags in command details view (Tab key)
- Tags are preserved during search and filtering operations
- Color-coded organization for quick visual categorization

### Sync Rules System

CommandChronicles includes a powerful sync rules system that gives you fine-grained control over which commands synchronize to which devices. Create rules to selectively include or exclude commands from specific devices based on flexible conditions.

```bash
# List your devices
ccr devices show

# Create basic rules
ccr rules allow work-laptop                    # Allow all commands to work laptop
ccr rules deny personal-phone                  # Deny all commands to phone

# Create conditional rules
ccr rules deny personal-phone --tag sensitive  # Deny sensitive commands to phone
ccr rules allow home-server --dir /projects    # Only sync /projects commands to server
ccr rules allow dev-machine --pattern "git*"   # Only sync git commands to dev machine

# Manage rules
ccr rules list                    # View all rules
ccr rules delete <rule-id>        # Delete a rule (supports 8-char IDs)
ccr rules simulate "git push"     # Test how rules would apply to a command
ccr rules conflicts               # Detect rule conflicts
```

**Sync Rules Features:**
- **Privacy Control**: Exclude personal/sensitive commands from work devices
- **Device-Specific Workflows**: Only sync relevant commands to each device
- **Conditional Filtering**: Apply rules based on tags, directories, command patterns, or time
- **Retroactive Application**: Rules automatically apply to all existing commands, not just new ones
- **Allow/Deny Logic**: Flexible rule combinations for precise control
- **Device Aliases**: Use friendly names instead of device IDs

**Rule Conditions:**
- **Tags**: `--tag docker` (commands with specific tags)
- **Directories**: `--dir /work` (commands from specific paths)
- **Patterns**: `--pattern "ssh*"` (commands matching patterns)
- **Time**: `--time "09:00-17:00"` (commands during specific hours)

**How It Works:**
Rules use **allow/deny logic** with **target devices**. When rules change, **all existing commands are automatically re-evaluated** and routing is updated across your devices. No rules means all commands sync everywhere (default behavior).

**Example Use Cases:**
- **Work/Personal Separation**: `ccr rules deny personal-laptop --tag work`
- **Server Deployments**: `ccr rules allow production-server --tag deploy`
- **Development Focus**: `ccr rules allow dev-machine --dir /code`
- **Time-Based Rules**: `ccr rules deny mobile --time "09:00-17:00"`
